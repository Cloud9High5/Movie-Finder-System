Week 1

What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:

1. Form a group
2. Set up GitHub team and jira project
3. Write user stories and sprints backlog

What was finished:

I joined the GitHub classroom team and integrate with our jira account.
I start up a template project code with react and flask and push to the main branch.
We decided on the timing of the three sprints and write user stories together, still work on it.
Finally, we create some backlog on jira.

What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work):

1. Jira workflow: we have a meeting together to figure how it works.
2. Two functional novelties: search google and do research of other similar projects.
3. User stories: brain storming.
4. Development Framework: self study.

what is planned for the next week:

1. Main page of front end.
2. finish the proposal.
3. find some movie data provider or API.
4. decide the two functional novelties.
